### My Earliest Code ###

This repository contains the code that I wrote when first learning how
to program computers. You'll need to have
[ Python ](http://python.org/download/releases/2.7.5) installed to play
around with it.

You should use this code to learn what *not* to do.

In chronological order:

#### The Fake Operating System Interface ####

* November 14, 2007: *Test4.py*
    * I wrote *Test4.py* within two weeks of looking at the Python
      manual for the first time. A very simple first step, it did a
      crude job of emulating a login prompt.

* December 6, 2007: *13.py*
    * With *13.py*, I expanded my fake login prompt into a fake
      operating system shell. The bugs in this version make it almost
      unusable.

* December 6, 2007: *14.py*
    * *14.py* fixes the major stability issues from *13.py*, and
      is actually kind of fun to fool around with.

    * The username is "Daniel", and the password is "Feathers". Or, if
      you would like to login as an unprivileged user (my old cat),
      you may login as "Oliver", with the password "Cat".

    * You may notice strongly-worded warnings that "root mode" can
      damage your computer. Ignore them; these programs are harmless
      toys, and the warnings are purely atmospheric.

* December 9, 2007: *19.py*
    * *19.py* consolidated much of the user information from a bunch
      of separate data structures into the User class.

* December 11, 2007: *20.py*
    * By *20.py*, the program could save users to, and load users
      from, a file.
